            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Alan Mathison Turing's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>1912</b> - Alan Turing born and grew up in the UK.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>1934</b> - Graduated at mathematics from King's College, Cambridge.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>1935</b> - Published a paper in which he introduced the idea of a universal Turing machine, a theoretical device that could compute any computable function.
                     This work laid the foundation for the development of the modern computer.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>World War II</b> - Turing worked at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park,
                     where he was involved in the effort to crack the German Enigma code. His work on the Enigma was critical to the Allies' success in the war.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>1950</b> - Published a paper on the topic of artificial intelligence, in which he introduced the Turing test, a thought experiment designed to determine whether a machine can think.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>1952</b> - He was prosecuted for homosexuality, which was illegal in the UK at the time.
                     He was convicted and given the choice of imprisonment or chemical castration. He chose the latter and was subjected to injections of female hormones.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>1954</b> - Died at the age of 41. The circumstances of his death are disputed,
                     but it is generally believed that he committed suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide.</p></li>
            </ul>
